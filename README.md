# QIS-Net
A Quantum-Inspired Self-Supervised Network model for automatic segmentation of brain MR images
A fully self-supervised novel quantum-inspired neural network model referred to as Quantum-Inspired Self-Supervised Network (QIS-Net) is proposed and tailored for fully automatic segmentation of brain MR images to obviate the challenges faced by deeply supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. 
The proposed QIS-Net architecture is composed of three layers of quantum neuron (input, intermediate and output) expressed as qbits. 
The intermediate and output layers of the QIS-Net architecture are inter-linked through bi-directional propagation of quantum states, wherein the image pixel intensities (quantum bits) are self-organized in between these two layers without any external supervision or training. 
The proposed self-supervised quantum-inspired network model has been tailored for and tested on Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast (DSC) brain MR images from Nature data sets for detecting complete tumor and reported promising accuracy and reasonable dice similarity scores.
